Flitrr goes beyond just organizing, by identifying the most frequent topics, sub-topics and summaries of what's being most discussed. This helps you fix the issues at its source.</p>

Flitrr does, and our predictive analytics can tell you whatâ€™s coming next and what historically has been hurting customers. The more data from a larger set of customers, the better we can predict. Flitrr also combines elements of productivity software to take action on the largest issues on the table. Whether that be for the day, month, year or past five years. All major investments require and deserve strong data to back up change. Flitrr provides you that data.</p>
