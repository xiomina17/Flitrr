                        <p className='image-p'>While Customer Service CRM software is a great way to organize your customer feedback data and respond, it often lacks the deeper analytics and insights needed to truly understand what your customers are saying. Flitrr goes beyond just organizing, by identifying the most frequent topics, sub-topics and summaries of what's being most discussed. This helps you fix the issues at its source.</p>

                        <p className='image-p'>Does your CRM give you the ability to organize and manage customer feedback in a way that lets you know what issues are most frequenting discussed and how people feel about an experience on a larger predictive scale? Flitrr does, and our predictive analytics can tell you whatâ€™s coming next and what historically has been hurting customers. The more data from a larger set of customers, the better we can predict. Flitrr also combines elements of productivity software to take action on the largest issues on the table. Whether that be for the day, month, year or past five years. All major investments require and deserve strong data to back up change. Flitrr provides you that data.</p>
