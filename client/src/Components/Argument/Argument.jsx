                            <p className='image-p'>There are three types of softwares that companies should be using customer service. The first is a customer relationships management system, or CRM, that specializes in customer service.

                    </div>
                    <div className="textblock">

                            <p>The second is a customer sentiment analytic software. A customer sentiment analytic software is a software that helps your business identify a percentage of customer complaints that are good or bad. Some of the more advanced customer sentiment analytic software goes into detail primitively on different types of topics that it picks up from the customer review data, but this technology's purpose is primarily to help businesses understand the percentage of happy and unhappy customers in their business overtime. </p>
